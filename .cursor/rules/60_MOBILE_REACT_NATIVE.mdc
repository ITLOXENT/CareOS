# Mobile App (React Native) Rules

## Stack Baseline
- React Native 0.83 line
- Use secure storage for tokens
- Push notifications must not include sensitive details in payload

## Functional MVP Requirements
- Medication schedule: reminders, taken confirmation, missed-dose tracking
- Pickup updates: push receive + in-app status view
- Caregiver mode: permissioned alerts
- Feedback submission: creates staff WorkItem

## Security
- Prevent screenshots on sensitive screens where platform allows.
- Token storage in platform secure store.
- Network calls via TLS only.

## Dev Safety
- Dev servers should not bind to public interfaces by default.
- Document safe dev configuration for teams.

## Testing
- Typecheck mandatory
- Minimal unit tests for reminder scheduling logic
- Build smoke test in CI (at least compile)

## Reliability
- Offline-friendly: queue submissions and retry when online
