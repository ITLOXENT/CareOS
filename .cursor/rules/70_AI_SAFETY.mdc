# AI Safety and Governance Rules

## Purpose
AI is used only for:
- triage suggestions
- drafting structured notes
- completeness checks
- summarizing evidence packs
- adherence risk scoring (non-diagnostic)

## Prohibited
- Diagnosis
- Treatment recommendations
- Medical advice
- Autonomous external sending of clinical-impact messages

## Human-in-the-Loop
- AIArtifact is required for any AI output that influences workflow.
- AIArtifact must store:
  - input references (hashed)
  - output payload
  - model and version
  - confidence score
  - reviewer decision and timestamp
- AI outputs require explicit approval before they can:
  - update an Episode state
  - be included in Evidence Pack exports
  - be sent via interop channels

## Prompt/Policy Versioning
- Each AI capability must have a policy template version.
- Log policy version with every artifact.

## Data Protection
- Minimize PHI in prompts.
- Do not send unnecessary identifiers to AI providers.
- Provide a redaction layer and log redaction decisions.

## Testing
- Tests must verify:
  - approval is required
  - audit events are written
  - outputs are deterministic under test stubs
