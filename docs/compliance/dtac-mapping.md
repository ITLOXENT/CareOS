Purpose
Map key DTAC themes to CareOS controls, implementation locations, and evidence.

Control 1: Data Protection Impact and Governance

- Evidence artifacts: infrastructure diagrams, IaC configs, vulnerability reports.
- Evidence generation: Terraform plan/apply logs, CI security scans.

Control 3: Interoperability and Data Exchange

- Control objective: Validate secure data exchange and auditability.
- Implementation location: pending (replace with specific repo path).
- Evidence artifacts: API specs, audit log samples, integration test reports.
- Evidence generation: OpenAPI export, audit log exports, CI test runs.

Control 4: Clinical Safety

- Control objective: Demonstrate clinical safety management and hazard tracking.
- Implementation location: pending (replace with specific repo path).
